# Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Description

The monty, a language intended to be equally suitable for both scripting and conventional programming.
Monty features an unusually flexible type system in which all values
are viewed as objects in a single-inheritance class hierarchy,
static and dynamic typing are smoothly integrated.

# Usage

Includes monty.h
The file argument must have a .m extension.
Included in the file should be the instructions for the byte code interpreter:

user:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
push 3$
pall    $
push 4$
push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
